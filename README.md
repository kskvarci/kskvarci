### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My 20+ year journey in technology hasn't been an easy one.
I'm consistently drawn down the most difficult paths.
It's on those paths where I've learned the most, generated the most impact and worked alongside the most inspiring people.

Cloud Computing: (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, Networking, Security, Governance, Automation, Solutions Architecture & Engineering, DevOps), Enterprise Architecture, Cross-Functional Team Leadership, Technology Product Management & Evangelization, Technical Instruction, End-User Computing Technologies, Program / Project Management, Technical Writing / Design
